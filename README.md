# 🛒 Amazon Vanilla JS Project
 

A fully responsive Amazon-inspired eCommerce web application built using **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules), HTML5, and CSS3**.

This project replicates real-world eCommerce functionality such as product browsing, cart management, checkout flow, order placement, and delivery selection. It focuses heavily on modular architecture, OOP design principles, asynchronous programming, and automated testing with Jasmine.

## 👨‍💻 Author

This project is created by **Adarsh Ranjan** as a learning-focused implementation to explore how modern web applications replicate real-world e-commerce platforms using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It is designed to demonstrate how core shopping features—such as product listings, cart management, checkout flow, order tracking, and data persistence—can be structured in a modular and maintainable way.

The project also serves as a sandbox for experimenting with scalable front-end architecture, where data modules, UI components, and utility functions are separated for clarity and reuse.

If you use or extend this project, you are encouraged to adapt it to your own workflow—whether that means integrating APIs, improving state management, or enhancing the UI/UX experience.

Contributions, improvements, and new ideas are always welcome.
